Smartacus was entirly created in 25 hours. The project is about a digital tour guide.
Our main goal was to connect it with landmarks google api so when you took a photo of a monument then it will recognize it for you.
After recognition was made information of the monument would be displayed from wikipedia.
Other than that we wanted to created two other activities that the user can do. The first one is to take a historic path and follow the monuments that have the same theme. We wanted also to implement a function which iput is the availible time of the user and the output would be the nearby monuments.
Lastly we made a small quiz about the monuments that the user have visited earlier.
